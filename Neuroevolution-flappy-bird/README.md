# NeuroEvolution-Flappy-Bird

## Introduction
This is a python3 implementation of Daniel Shiffman's [Neuroevolution flappy bird-Coding challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtRA6tqgJBc)
The aim is to teach a bunch of "Birds" to navigate a basic version of the game "Flappy Bird" made independently in pygame. The neural networks learn using an evolutionary algorithm instead of the traditional sgd method.

Dependencies include : pygame, numpy, matplotlib
 
## Usage
Run main.py to start the simulation. Control parameters like population count, number of frames to be skipped per cycle can be changed in "info" dictionary in main.py file.
Press the UP key on pygame screen to increase speed of the simulation.
If you want to play the manual mode, run main.py file in Flappy-Bird-manual folder.
